/*
 * - BSY (Busy) is set whenever the device has control of the command
 *   Block Registers. When the BSY bit is equal to one, a write to a
 *   command block register by the host shall be ignored by the
 *   device.
 *
 *   The device shall not change the state of the DRQ bit unless the
 *   BSY bit is equal to one. When the last block of a PIO data in
 *   command has been transferred by the host, then the DRQ bit is
 *   cleared without the BSY bit being set.
 *
 *   When the BSY bit equals zero, the device may only change the IDX,
 *   DRDY, DF, DSC, and CORR bits in the Status register and the Data
 *   register. None of the other command block registers nor other
 *   bits within the Status register shall be changed by the device.
 *
 *   NOTE - BIOSs and software device drivers that sample status as
 *   soon as the BSY bit is cleared to zero may not detect the
 *   assertion of the CORR bit by the device. After the host has
 *   written the Command register either the BSY bit shall be set, or
 *   if the BSY bit is cleared, the DRQ bit shall be set, until
 *   command completion.
 *
 *   NOTE - The BSY bit is set and then cleared so quickly, that host
 *   detection of the BSY bit being set is not certain.
 *
 *   The BSY bit shall be set by the device under the following
 *   circumstances:
 *     a) within 400 ns after either the negation of RESET- or the
 *        setting of the SRST bit in the Device Control register;
 *     b) within 400 ns after writing the Command register if the DRQ
 *        bit is not set;
 *     c) between blocks of a data transfer during PIO data in
 *        commands if the DRQ bit is not set;
 *     d) after the transfer of a data block during PIO data out
 *        commands if the DRQ bit is not set;
 *     e) during the data transfer of DMA commands if the DRQ bit is
 *        not set.
 *
 *   The device shall not set the BSY bit at any other time.
 *
 * - DRDY (Device Ready) is set to indicate that the device is capable
 *   of accepting all command codes. This bit shall be cleared at
 *   power on. Devices that implement the power management features
 *   shall maintain the DRDY bit equal to one when they are in the
 *   Idle or Standby power modes. When the state of the DRDY bit
 *   changes, it shall not change again until after the host reads the
 *   status register.
 *
 *   When the DRDY bit is equal to zero, a device responds as follows:
 *     a) the device shall accept and attempt to execute the EXECUTE
 *        DEVICE DIAGNOSTIC and INITIALIZE DEVICE PARAMETERS commands;
 *     b) If a device accepts commands other than EXECUTE DEVICE
 *        DIAGNOSTIC and INITIALIZE DEVICE PARAMETERS during the time the
 *        DRDY bit is equal to zero, the results are vendor specific.
 *
 * - DF (Device Fault) indicates a device fault error has been
 *   detected. The internal status or internal conditions that causes
 *   this error to be indicated is vendor specific.
 *
 * - DSC (Device Seek Complete) indicates that the device heads are
 *   settled over a track. When an error occurs, this bit shall not be
 *   changed until the Status register is read by the host, at which
 *   time the bit again indicates the current Seek Complete status.
 *
 * - DRQ (Data Request) indicates that the device is ready to transfer
 *   a unsigned short or char of data between the host and the device.
 *
 * - CORR (Corrected Data) is used to indicate a correctable data
 *   error. The definition of what constitutes a correctable error is
 *   vendor specific. This condition does not terminate a data
 *   transfer.
 *
 * - IDX (Index) is vendor specific.
 *
 * - ERR (Error) indicates that an error occurred during execution of
 *   the previous command. The bits in the Error register have
 *   additional information regarding the cause of the error. Once the
 *   device has set the error bit, the device shall not change the
 *   contents of the following items until a new command has been
 *   accepted, the SRST bit is set to one, or RESET- is asserted: the
 *   ERR bit in the Status register.
