/*
 * System independent routines for controlling the built in indicator LEDs

 * Indicators on the C256 and most of the A2560 lines of computers will be built in to
 * the board and contolled by GABE. They will usually be simple off-on indicators.
 *
 * On the A2560K, the indicators are RGB LEDs on the keyboard or build into the machine.
